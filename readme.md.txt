Here's a nice SQL challenge that I have done recently.
There are 2 friends Jack and Julie.
Jack has a list of holdings that represents stock name and amount he owns.
Julie has a Model that represents stock name and percentage she owns of the stock.
for the holding table, the Total amount is $1000.
For the Model table, the Total percentage is 100%

We would like to map Jack's holdings to Julie's Model.
We have a table of orders represented by stock name, amount, and operation type.
We are looking for a list of stocks that we need to buy or sell in order to match holdings with any given model.
